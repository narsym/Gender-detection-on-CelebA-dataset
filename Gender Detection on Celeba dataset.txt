1. Data set is directly loaded from kaggle into colab.
2. Two csv files list eval partition and list celeba are used.
3. training set consists of 5000 images and test set consists of 1000 images.
4. training and test sets are balanced with equal no of male and female images.
5. data is loaded into raw_train and raw_test images using opencv.
6. then data is converted to tf.data.Dataset object using from_tensor_slices method.
7. data is then divided into batches.
8. for the model MobileNetV2 is used.
9. Top layer is removed and one neuron is added for classifying gender.
10. for optimizer rmsprop is used.
11. The model is trained is for 20 epochs and it achieved 88% accuracy on the test.
12. But I have observed when it is trained for 30 epochs the accuracy reaches 90%.
